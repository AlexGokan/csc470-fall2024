Design Doc: Bicycle Racing Simulator

<--- Gameplay --->
You will control a pro cyclist on his way to professional racing glory! Control your tactics, energy expenditure, sprints, and character stats, to turn yourself into the ultimate cyclist

<--- Story/Theme --->
The story will be based on the classic bicycle velodrome races, and particulary the legendary Ghent 6-day, an annual fan-favorite race in Belgium

<--- Controls --->
The plan is to use WASD controls - W/S for increasing/decreasing power, and A/D for steering. Q for all out sprints, and C for changing camera angles. But this is subject to change, maybe some of it will be a clickable UI element instead

<--- Visual Style --->
I plan to make most of the assets in blender. At the minimum there will be animated cyclists with the speed of their legs depending on their energy expenditure. I plan on going for a low-ish poly style with flat lighting and colorful character models

<--- Audio Style --->
I will likely play background music of the sort that plays at sporting events, and roaring crowd noises as the sprint finish ramps up, as well as when any crashes occur

<--- Interface --->
I plan on keeping the interface pretty minimal. There will be "health bars" in the corner for sprint stamina, endurance stamina, and maybe equipment condition. Since this will be a fast paced game I want to keep the controls on the keyboard instead of having clickable elements since that requires changing focus


<--- Feature Set targets --->
 -->Minimum
1. Control your indivisual cyclist
2. A track racing mode over a set number of laps
3. Animated cyclists (both yourself and AI opponents)

 -->Expected
 1. Crashing mechanic
 2. Extra animations based on available energy level

 -->Stretch Goals
 1. AI that does something non-trivial
 2. More interesting courses with elevation changes and multi-day races
 3. Controllable teammates
 4. Customizable characeristics (endurance, sprint speed, body weight, etc)
